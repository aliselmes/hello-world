# hello-world
My first repository!

Hello!

I'm Alasdair and I'm just starting out on my coding journey after working as a French and Spanish teacher in my first career. I am following the Web Developer path on Code Academy and also working through freeCodeCamp, as well as commiting to the #100daysofcode challenge! I'm looking forward to starting this journery in ernest and connecting with other developers!
